# IntellegentPirateAgent-CS370
This was a problem that I solved using reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a maze. 
The jupityr notebook that I supplied was an assignment from my CS370 course, most of the code for the problem was given to me minus the section that says TODO. This was the brain of the intelligent pirate agent, After a few itterations of the code I came to what you see in the notebook. It will run until it solves the problem or hits 999 attempts. As a computer scientiest I solve problems with a focus on trial and error, utilizing whatever tools I have available to solve the problems given. With todays age being heavily reliant on AI solutions its important to check over any AI provided code and test its production. If I dont understand how something works I push myself to learn it and replicate it. Ethically I want to keep the human element prevalent while taking advantage of the speed with the tools we have access to.
